--------------------------- Things to fix first -----------------------------

* Rewrite from scratch using the Aircraft base code or, continue using the same base but you will no longer receive updates to the Minicraft plus base mod (Thinking...)
* Redesign the sky or turn it into a completely different dimension

+ Update the textures
+ Update the code and solve Minciraft plus bugs (again)
+ Trying to add a body to cthulhu XD

- Correct the version control (for some strange reason the .jar of 0.05 is recognized as 0.06, what an error xd)
