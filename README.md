The goal is to add features that extend the game and story, improve the graphics by taking advantage of the RGB color and resolution engine of Minicraft + "2.0.6", enhance the textures as best as possible, and also add improvements to the interface. texts, menus. etc.

# To clarify...
- Cthulhucraft is the rewrite of Aircraft in order to avoid bigger mistakes than the alpha versions had and to considerably improve the concept
- Cthulhucraft is largely based on Minicraft plus and also the first version of Minicraft, in addition to containing various things from Aircraft (in short a Frankenstein)
- The mod has compatibility with Minicraft plus 2.0.6 (you can load worlds of that version in the mod, but not load worlds from Cthulhucraft to Minicraft).
- The mod is in Beta phase, it is continuously updated to clean most of the bugs, do maintenance, and add features
