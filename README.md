# Cthulhucraft
After spending 2 months developing the Alpha phase of Aircraft ... here is the beta ..., Cthulhucraft add new bosses, challenges, new objects and new toys lol, new graphics and options in order to have a good gameplay

The goal is to add features that extend the game and story, improve the graphics by taking advantage of the RGB color and resolution engine of Minicraft + "2.0.6", enhance the textures as best as possible, and also add improvements to the interface. texts, menus. etc.

- in short, try to make a more complete version of Minicraft, and make Minicraft more interesting.


# Features to implement
- New boss diversity
- New vegetation
- Notable graphics improvement (Aircraft- Rcraft 2.0)
- A.i improvement of mobs and entities
- More mobs, enemies and animals
- Reimplementation of old Aircraft mod features (Snowy biome, wolves / dogs, cats, ice tools, woods and vegetation)
- Story mode
- Implementation of Enchantment Books and enchanted tools
- Villages added with Villagers and iron golems, in addition to rusty Golems as Mini-bosses, the celestial dungeon was also added


# To clarify...
- Cthulhucraft is largely based on Minicraft plus and also the first version of Minicraft, in addition to containing various things from Aircraft (in short a Frankenstein)
- The mod has compatibility with Minicraft plus 2.0.6 (you can load worlds of that version in the mod, but not load worlds from Cthulhucraft to Minicraft).
- The mod is in Beta phase, it is continuously updated to clean most of the bugs, do maintenance, and add features
